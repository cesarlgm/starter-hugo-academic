I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Boston University. I am a labor economist who works in labor markets in both developed and developing countries. My research interests lie in both labor and development economics.


My research focuses on understanding how geography influences gender inequality. My other work explores topics such as firms and earnings inequality, skill investment, and job training programs. 


I am on the 2022-2023 economics job market and I will be available for interviews during the ASSA and EJME meetings.


I pronounce my name as [ˈse.saɾ].
